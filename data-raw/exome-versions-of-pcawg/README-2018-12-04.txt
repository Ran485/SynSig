This folder contains mutational spectra catalogs for PCAWG7 
genomes "projected" to Agilent Sureselect V7 exome-capture target
regions -- ie only variants in the exome capture regions are
represented.

All samples present in the whole-genome spectra catalogs are 
represented (2780 tumours). Therefore some have 0 mutations in
every category.

The conventions for all files except pcawg-as-exome-COMPOSITE.csv
are the same as for the whole-genome catalog spectra on Synapse. 

For the COMPOSITE file, the first column contains the following:

The first 1536 rows after the header contain six characters in
{A, C, G, T}. The first 5 characters are the reference sequence, 
with the mutated base at the center, and the 6th character
indicating the variant base. For example, AGCTAT represents a 
mutation from AGCTA > AGTTA.

The next 78 rows are for DBS (doublet base substitutions, aka 
dinucleotide substitutions), with the two reference variants 
followed by the two mutated bases. For example, AACG represents a
mutation from AA > CG.

The remaining rows are indels, following the classification and 
conventions in pcawg-as-exome-ID.csv, except that the contents of
the first four columns of pcawg-as-exome-ID.csv are encoded in a
single, :-separated string in column 1 in 
pcawg-as-exome-COMPOSITE.
